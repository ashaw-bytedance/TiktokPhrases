# TiktokPhrases

Inside this project, you'll see a list of phrases that are common on TikTok - `phrases.txt` or `phrases.json`.

The goal of this exercise is to create a dataset fron these phrases, so that we can train an NLP language model.

To do so, you'll need to create a word dictionary and vectorize each phrase to the corresponding index. You will also need to handle punctuation and word-casing.

For example:
Creating a life I love  -> 1 2 3 4 5
creating a life I love. -> 1 2 3 4 5
Be a little more you    -> 6 2 7 8 9
